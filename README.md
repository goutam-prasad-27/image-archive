# Image Archive Website

This is a simple HTML and CSS code for an image archive website.

## Features

- Displays a grid of images.
- Hovering over an image brightens it and applies a 3D rotation effect.
- Neighboring images dim and rotate slightly on hover for a cool visual effect.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
- Image files placed in a folder named "images" within the same directory as the HTML file.

## Instructions

1. Replace the placeholder image names (`dark-1.jpeg`, `dark-2.jpeg`, etc.) with your own image filenames.
2. You can customize the styles in the `style.css` file to match your preferences.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a new folder for your project and copy the following files into it:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- A folder named "images" containing your image files.

Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the image archive website in action.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the styles in the `style.css` file to match your preferences. You can also add more images to the "images" folder to expand your archive.
