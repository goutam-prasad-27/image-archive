This is a simple HTML and CSS code for an image archive website. 

**Features:**

* Displays a grid of images.
* Hovering over an image brightens it and applies a 3D rotation effect.
* Neighboring images dim and rotate slightly on hover for a cool visual effect.

**Requirements:**

* Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
* Image files placed in a folder named "images" within the same directory as the HTML file.

**Instructions:**

1. Replace the placeholder image names (`dark-1.jpeg`, `dark-2.jpeg`, etc.) with your own image filenames.
2. You can customize the styles in the `style.css` file to match your preferences. 
3. The comments within the CSS (`TODO`) indicate areas where you can play around with transition speeds and filter effects to achieve different visual results.
